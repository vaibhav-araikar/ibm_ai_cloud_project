# 🎓 LearnMate – AI-Powered Personalized Learning Companion

**LearnMate** is an intelligent AI-driven educational assistant developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Internship on AI and Cloud Technologies**. Powered by IBM Watsonx.ai, it acts as a prompt-engineered agent that generates personalized learning pathways based on user goals, interests, and existing knowledge levels.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

The primary objective of LearnMate is to assist learners in identifying and following structured learning paths for in-demand tech careers like:

- ✅ Data Scientist  
- ✅ Web Developer  
- ✅ AI/ML Engineer  

Unlike conventional course recommenders, **LearnMate is a fully prompt-engineered agent** — no frontend, backend, or database needed. All intelligence lies within the AI model prompts and logic deployed through IBM Watsonx.
